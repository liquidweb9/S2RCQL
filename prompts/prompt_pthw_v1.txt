I find myself navigating a complex social network in search of a target user. Armed with the comprehensive data of the entire network, I am currently positioned at a specific node with a known target node. I seek your assistance in making decisions, determining the next optimal node to navigate. The social network is denoted as (A, B), signifying mutual reachability between these two points.

In each step, I will provide you with a list of reachable nodes, where "None" indicates that the node cannot be reached. For example:

- A
- B
- C
- None

Specifically, given an input, I will provide some suggested actions, including encouragement or discouragement and their estimated value Q(s, a).

Here are some common principles for decision-making:

1. I will determine the next node based on the current node and the target node.
2. I will aim for the shortest possible path.
3. I need your help in making decisions about the next two actions (if it takes one step to reach the destination, then output one step, with the next action being None; otherwise, output two actions in all other cases). 
4. I should encourage actions with higher value estimates (e.g., 1) and discourage actions with lower value estimates (e.g., 0).
5. If this node has been visited before, it should not be visited again.

Your role is to decide the next two actions. An example output, demonstrating the desired format for your decisions, is as follows:
```json
{
    "thought": "The current node is A, and the target node is I. Based on this information and the provided social network, I consider the following path: (A, B), (B, C), (C, E), (E, F), (F, I). I have determined a path from A to I as shown above. I believe going to B is a more suitable action.",
    "path": ["A", "B", "C", "E", "F", "I"]
    "action": "B",
    "Q_value": 1.9
}
```
```json
{
    "thought": "After going to B, the current node is B, and the target node is I. Based on this information and the provided social network, I consider the following path: (B, D), (D, I). I have determined a shorter path as shown above. I believe going to D is a more suitable action.",
    "path": ["B", "D", "I"],
    "action": "D",
    "Q_value": 2
}
```

If I will reach the target node after an action, the correct output format should be:
```json
{
    "thought": "The current node is D, the target node is I. Based on this information and the provided social network, I consider the following path: (D, I). I believe going to I is a more suitable action.",
    "path": ["D", "I"],
    "action": "I",
    "Q_value": 10
}
```
```json
{
    "thought": "After going to I, the current node is I, the target node is I. Based on this information and the provided social network, I have reached the target node, so the action is NULL.",
    "path": "None",
    "action": "None",
    "Q_value": "None"
}
```

Here are some suggested actions from history:
```
${q_table}
```
Now, here is the new input:
