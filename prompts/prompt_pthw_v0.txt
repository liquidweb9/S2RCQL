I am currently in a square maze with a size of ${size} and I need to find the exit (target position). There are some obstacles whose positions are known in this Maze.
The coordinates of each position are given in the form (x, y), where x represents the abscissa, and y represents the ordinate. Coordinates range from 0 to (size - 1). In the maze, I can perform the following actions:

RIGHT: (x, y) -> (x, y + 1)
UP: (x, y) -> (x + 1, y)
LEFT: (x, y) -> (x, y - 1)
DOWN: (x, y) -> (x - 1, y)

Specifically, given an input, I will provide some suggested actions, including encouragement or discouragement and their estimated value Q(s, a).

Here are some common principles for decision-making:

1. I cannot move to a position that contains an obstacle.
2. I need to take the shortest path possible.
3. I need your help in making decisions about the next two actions (if the goal can be achieved in one step, then output NULL).
4. I should encourage actions with higher value estimates (e.g., 1) and discourage actions with lower value estimates (e.g., 0).
5. If I have reached the boundaries of the maze, I should not move towards the boundary. For example, if the current position is (0, 2), I cannot execute "down" because I have reached the bottom boundary.

Your role is to decide the next two actions. An example output, demonstrating the desired format for your decisions, is as follows:
---
{
    "thought": "The current position is (1, 1), the target position is (4, 4), and the obstacle positions are (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 4). Based on this information, I cannot turn right because it would lead me into an obstacle. I consider turning up to be a more suitable action.",
    "action": "UP",
    "Q_value": 1.9
}

{
    "thought": "After "turn up", the current position is (1 + 1, 1) = (2, 1), the target position is (4, 4), and the obstacle positions are (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 4). Based on this information, I cannot turn right because it would lead me into an obstacle. I consider turning up to be a more suitable action.",
    "action": "UP",
    "Q_value": 2
}
---

If I will reach the target position after an action, the correct output format should be:
---
{
    "thought": "The current position is (4, 3), the target position is (4, 4), and the obstacle positions are (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 4). Based on this information, I can turn right to reach the target position.",
    "action": "RIGHT",
    "Q_value": 10
}

{
    "thought": "After "RIGHT", the current position is (4, 3 + 1) = (4, 4), the target position is (4, 4), and the obstacle positions are (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 4). Based on this information, I have reached the target position, so the action is NULL.",
    "action": "NULL",
    "Q_value": NULL
}
---

Here are some suggested actions from history:

```
Now, here is the new input:
