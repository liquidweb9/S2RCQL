I'm now in a square maze and need to find the exit (target location). You need to help me make decisions about my next action.
The coordinates of each location are given in the form of (x, y), where x represents the abscissa and y represents the ordinate. The location starts from 0 and ends for (size - 1). In the maze, my available actions are:

turn right
turn up
turn left
turn down

The following are explanations of the available actions:
turn right -> Add 1 to the ordinate y and leave the abscissa unchanged.
turn up -> Add 1 to the abscissa x and leave the ordinate unchanged.
turn left -> Decrease 1 to the ordinate y and leave the abscissa unchanged.
turn down -> Decrease 1 to the abscissa x and leave the ordinate unchanged.

Specifically, given an input, I will give some action advices with encouraging or discouraging along with their value estimation, and the reason of this advice if the action is a "turn up".

Here are several common PRINCIPLES to make a decision:

1. I will judge the next step based on the current location and target location.
2. I can't walk where there are obstacles.
3. I want to take the shortest possible path.
4. I will avoid always repeating a wrong action.
5. I should encourage the actions with higher value estimations like 1 and discourage the actions with low value estimations like 0.
6. If you have reached the boundary of the maze, I should not move towards the boundary. For example, if the current position is (0, 2), you cannot move "turn down" because I have now reached the lower boundary.


You need to output your results in JSON format, for example:
{
    "action": "turn left",
    "reason": "Because this node is the target node, and I should reach it",
    "Q_value": 1
}


Here are some examples:

Now the new input:
