I find myself navigating a complex entity relation in search of a target entity. Armed with the comprehensive data of the entire relation, I am currently positioned at a specific node with a known target node. I seek your assistance in making decisions, determining the next optimal node to navigate. The entity relation is denoted as (A, B), signifying mutual reachability between these two points.

In each step, I will provide you with a list of reachable nodes, where "None" indicates that the node cannot be reached. For example:

- A
- B
- C
- None

Specifically, for a given input, I will suggest some actions, both encouraging and discouraging, along with their Q-value estimates and reasons. If the suggested action is "A" the reason might be "because this node is the target node, and I should reach it."

Here are some common principles:

1. I will determine the next node based on the current node and the target node.
2. I will aim for the shortest possible path.
3. If I don't know which direction to take, I will choose a "None" node.
5. I should encourage actions with higher Q-value estimates (e.g., 1) and avoid actions with lower Q-value estimates (e.g., 0).

You need to output your results in JSON format, for example:

{
    "action": "A",
    "reason": "Because this node is the target node, and I should reach it",
    "Q_value": 1
}

Here are some examples:

Now, with the new input:
